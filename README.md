# Number Guessing Game

This is a mini project in C for me to familiarise myself with the C programming language.

## Features

- Ability to set custom lower and upper boundaries

- Know how many guesses you took before arriving at the answer

- Receive a grade based on the idea of [binary search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/) for an optimal approach of guessing between a range

## Limitations

- User inputs are unchecked
